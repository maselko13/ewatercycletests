Sheet of technical questions we have (Defacto agenda):

1a) What is the pull request, where is it from, can we see examples, can we see what tests fail and pass?

1b) What info do we get about the data, where is the model from, what type is the model?

2a) The eWaterCycle base model has different methods than the base models, where is the proper documentation?

2b) What variables do models share (which are global, which are typing, which are regional)

3) Do our requirements meet your standards, how should we quantify them, do we need to negotiate about the amounts?

4) What constitutes business logic?

5) How should we measure accuracy (what error method?), how much error should a model be allowed to have?

6) Can we have some faulty models to verify our tests?

7) How should we structure test banks? (regions, criticality)

8) Where should our test report be generated, is it supposed to be a github webhook? (block approval)

9) How should we handle it when an approved model gets updated?

10) What is going to merge into what, how do we get exact files?

11) Are there models we need to test for that do not use a lumped or distributed base?
