Notes of week 5 meeting with Timur
location: TU Delft library
time: 16:30 - 17:00

notes:

-Timur apoligizes for being too nice

-we only started "working" in week 4 so we got harsh feedback

-equalize work

-write out plan clearly

-Do not go crazy:
	50 to 100 tests should be fine for a must
	
-Requirements should immediatly become issues, assign them among ourselves at the start of the week

-Give issues time estimates

-Make a pipeline

-Documentation:
	make more comments, write a readme "how to install, how to run tests, blahblah"
	
-For the demo:
	the demo is unclear, explain better
	Timur idea: "open a pull request, show code is running, this is what it will output"
	show it passing and failing tests
	
-You run it and then is tells what tests pass and fail, if pass then allow aproval, else do not
	look up pre-merge hooks
	we will get all the info, just need to see what we can pull
	
-Report in a week:
	List of requirements
	week by week plan
	time estimation and teamwork plans
	requirements + 1 page of explain
	
-Timur will send code distribution
	does not have to be equal, two people are not even on the git inspector
	
-Throw everything on the github!

-Distribution is 1/4th of the planning grade

-Work distribution only takes into account lines written (lol)
	also stuff like q&a's and presentation
	
-Do not show gitinspect on the final presentation

-Explain how issues are split up between everyone

-Everyone works together on the musts, shoulds and coulds

-During q&a you should spread out questions more evenly (give an internal planning split beforehand) (try not to answer subsequent questions)

-We can demo using github, all the code still needs to be on gitlab for review

-Our repo should be clonable from github, and then work immediatly with github (so no two versions)
	documentation is important because the client 
	readmes and comments (readmes are more important)

-You can add different readmes in different folders and those readmes can explain different things

-A documents folder for readmes would be nice

-For the client and the coach send them a copy of the extra plan
	show initiative and communicate with them
	make emails so we have receipts (worst case)
	
-If we work consistently we will get the We

-Before we send the extra plan to Client and Coach send it to Timur for review

-Make a datumprikker for the datumprikker for the week 10 presentations
