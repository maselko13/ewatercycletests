Notes:
- Timur will be our first contact point for when things go wrong
  he'll be partially responsible for grading and will be giving us passive advice
  about the project

- For subsequent meetings we should prepare an agenda, perhaps showing of the demo and informing him what we
  have been doing
  
- We explained to Timur the basis of our project (testing hydrological plugin testing interface)

- Informed Timur about group forming process

- We should discuss what grade we are aiming to get (personally not too bothered)

- Show that we are not doing stuff randomly, but using some systematic process
  we show this through meetings, requirements engineering, gitlab usage
  project owner, TA, and TU coach will give their opinion on how we utilised
  them in our project
  
- Nothing is graded until the final report

- Come to Timur for feedback intermitently

  you can copy paste the project plan into final report so make it nice to save
  yourselves work early

- Collect peoples schedules for the week 5 midterm, and plan it early

  we of course must be there for the mid and endterm

- We should schedule meetings with the coaches and project owner but should prepare stuff beforehand
  and send them materials before such a meeting
