Notes of meeting with Rolf Hut 22-04-2024 week 1
location: Civil engineering building TU Delft
time: 13:00 - 13:30

Notes:
- Ewatercycle meeting:
	to be planned after week 2

- course requirements:
	software requirements due week 2
	technical writing on mondays
	presentation at the end of the course
	rest is up to product owner

- Rolf won't be available next week 

- split group up according to agile/scrum methodology

- Hydrology:
	doing research about understanding what water does after falling from the athmosphere
	used for predicting for water management (rivers, farmland, lakes, evaporation)
	forecast model => weather information
	precipitation => all form of events where water falls on the ground
	cubic metres per second => form in which we talk about water flow rate in a river
	
- Problem:
	Hydrologists are all trying to solve the same problem in different landscapes
	different landscapes give different data, different models
	
	it boils down to rainfall in water out
	
	local assumptions can cause models to be different for example:
		wageningen => 9 different soil layers, optional snow setting
		finland => 9 different snow types, 1 soil layer
	leads to slightly different results
	
	models are also made in differing programming languages
	
	eWatercycle uses jupyter environments to call models in containers, because it is defined in many languages it becomes a type of
	universal adapter, BMI allows you to communicate between programming languages by converting types between languages.
	
	one jupyter environment can access multiple models.
	
	eWatercycle used to be one big package, they have moved to a plugin based system
	
	Third parties can make plugins for eWatercycle, we need to make software that can test these third party plugins
	- is it properly implemented?
	- is it secure?
	- is business logic ok? (we need to figure this out through talking with eWatercycle employees)
	- should not be set in stone, checks can be turned on and off and more checks can be added, without needing to be a computer scientist
	- distinction between hard fails and warnings (some kind of certificates for being good at some things)
	
- We are getting access to jupyter notebooks to test out eWatercycle from an user perspective 
- Next meeting on thursday morning 10 o'clock (25-04-2024)
- Docs are updated to eWatercycle 2, but online info tends to still be on eWatercycle 1
