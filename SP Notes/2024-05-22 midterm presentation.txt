Notes of post midterm presentation
location: TU Delft library
time: 16:00 - 16:30

Notes:

-there are doubts if we are progressing properly

-we are getting a red flag
	does not mean we fail, it is formative
	we must pick up for the final presentation
	
-if this was the final we would've failed

-quality in software, quality and documentation is lacking:
	no reasonable work in terms of software
	last week our git was empty
	it is a _software_ project, our product needs to be on point

-product does not warrent 4.5 weeks of work in terms of coding and design quality

-product does not seem to make use of the proper infrastructure

-requirements should have been done in the first two weeks:
	have them fully sharpened using SMART requirements

-In the final presentation we must reason that all our musts are done and dusted:
	for example not "a lot of tests"

-Document what we do and implement it into the gitlab wiki, if its reported but not visible they cannot judge us

-In terms of planning we should be more clear about what we are doing

-Make more use of the client (Rolf wants more contact with us)

-Get more feedback on how to improve from our TA, Client and Coach

-Looking at what we have delivered there is a very skewed distribution of code contribution:
	they want to see the code distribution equalize
	
-Presentation content was fine
	Tech stack and quality was missing but we got it in the Q&A
	
-Demo was not sufficient:
	show tests passing and failing in the application setting

-Q&A was good, answers should be shorter and do not be afraid "we did not xyz this", this frees up time to answer actual questions

-Try to have a more balanced Q&A

-The two people that did not present will do the final presentation:
	if you distribute among these two +1 extra it should be fine, the two "newcomers" should have majority however

how to repair:
-Use the time tomorrow to grab _all requirements_ 
	make them SMART!
	haggle with the client what amount of tests we can implement, what is realistic

-Contact Coach with these requirements and how we are going to reach them in a reasonable time using weekly plannings:
	At the latest they want an update halfway through week 6:
		how we make everything measurable and reachable

-Our main problem is the requirements!
	Our working in an unfocused manner which impedes our progress greatly

-Rolf has our back

-Initiative and communication should also be expanded on not only within the group but also outside of it:
	we must be more creative and work on what we can work on
	
-We are allowed to be faster than our plans, it is lower bound

-MoSCoW rule of thumb: must haves by week 8, rest can be added after

-Please be realistic and find an agreement that works with you client and coach

-Make more use of the Client and Coach

-Do not overload yourselves!

-Today is formative, next week we give repair plan, if repair plan is succesful we will pass.

-WE NEED TO GET GOING!

-We can reach co-ordinators by mid next week

-In what form should the plan be? pdf or smth
